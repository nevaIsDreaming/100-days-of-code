# 100-days-of-code
I'm committing to code one hour a day for 100 days! This will be perfect for my coding habit 

Day 1, Jaunary 9, 2017:
A bit late to the party here since everyone else started last week. Let's agree that it's just fashionable.

Today's Progress: Joined the challenge. Worked on intermediate algorithm scripting on FCC. 

Thoughts: I'm a tad bit rusty on all of this since I took a substantial holiday break, but I'm picking up where I left off.

Day 2&3, January 11-12, 2017:
Progress: Finished my Wikipedia Viewer for Free Code Camp today. 

Thoughts: It was fun playing around with all the CSS styling on this page. I kept it very basic, but it was a good review.

Day 4 January 13, 2017:
Progress: Did a lot to update my personal portfolio page. I added a biography section to the page.

Thoughts: This was a good HTML/CSS review.

Day 5 January 14., 2017:
Progress: Pseduo-coded the algorithm for the Roman Numeral Converter on Free Code Camp. 

Thoughts: I really like scripting.

Days 6-8 January 15-17, 2017:
Progress: Finished the Roman Numeral Converter for Free Code Camp. Invested 4+ hours so far muddling my way through the WhereforeArtThou challenge. 

Thoughts: Am I cheating by updating this in chunks like this? This challenge is complex and, well, challenging. I've tried a couple different approaches and have concluded (after collaborating with other campers in chat) that there is no way around using nested for loops. I'm thinking I'll have to draw a picuture of it and do more pseudo-coding to help think through it. It's good to be working on something more challenging. 

Link to work: I don't have too much to show today since there isn't a solution to what I've been working on.

Day 11 January 20, 2017:
Progress: Continued work on Wherefore Art Thou, and developed a concept for a pen on CodePen. 

Thoughts: Slow and steady.

Days 12-19 January 21-29th:
Progress: The first couple of days of this last week were spent on finishing the Wherefore Art Thou algorithm. More intermediate algorithms. Today and yesterday I worked more on the basic website prototype. Today's work focused on customizing a bootstrap navbar. 

Thoughts: After finally coming up with a solution to Wherefore Art Thou, I rejoiced and then cruised through the next few challenges. My little design project is coming along too. At this point, an error in the code somewhere is preventing the dropdowns from working, or the collapsibilty for smaller screens. Yikes! Here comes the trouble shooting!

Days 20-25 January 30 to February 4th:
Progress: Algorithm scripting challenges. 

Thoughts: Not so easy to do while sick.

Days 26-41 February 5-20th:
Progress: Dropdowns and algorithms. 

Thoughts: Progress has been minimal. Life has gotten quite exciting with children and flu season, but I have done a few more alogrithms, and had a good group coding session with my local FCC group where I got help and fixed the drop down issue that I was having on the Fuzzy Wuzzy site above. Collapsability is still an issue. 

Days 42-69 February 21 to March 20:
Progress: Completed Free Code Camp Intermediate Algorithms. Free Code Camp calculator bonfire in progress.

Thoughts: Who knew there was so much to think about with a simple four function calculator? It's been eye-opening to see the different conditions that are required to get the calculator running without errors. I have it working now so that the numbers can be entered and the number will not exceed the space given in the calculator's screen. If it does, there is an error message. I had to edit my code to make sure that more than one decimal cannot appear in a number. It also took a surprisingly long time to get to the point of even writing the javascript for the buttons on the calculator. Getting the buttons into a grid pattern was probably the trickiest part of the HTML/CSS phase. But I got a lot of good exposure to different grid systems including bootstrap grid (and applying it specifically within a div), Susy, the new CSS grid, and flex box, which is what I ended up using in my layout.
