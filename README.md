# 100-days-of-code
I'm committing to code one hour a day for 100 days! This will be perfect for my coding habit 

Day 1, Jaunary 9, 2017:
A bit late to the party here since everyone else started last week. Let's agree that it's just fashionable.

Today's Progress: Joined the challenge. Worked on intermediate algorithm scripting on FCC. 

Thoughts: I'm a tad bit rusty on all of this since I took a substantial holiday break, but I'm picking up where I left off.
