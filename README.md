# 100-days-of-code
I'm committing to code one hour a day for 100 days! This will be perfect for my coding habit 

Day 1, Jaunary 9, 2017:
A bit late to the party here since everyone else started last week. Let's agree that it's just fashionable.

Today's Progress: Joined the challenge. Worked on intermediate algorithm scripting on FCC. 

Thoughts: I'm a tad bit rusty on all of this since I took a substantial holiday break, but I'm picking up where I left off.

Day 2&3, January 11-12, 2017:
Progress: Finished my Wikipedia Viewer for Free Code Camp today. 

Thoughts: It was fun playing around with all the CSS styling on this page. I kept it very basic, but it was a good review.

Day 4 January 13, 2017:
Progress: Did a lot to update my personal portfolio page. I added a biography section to the page.

Thoughts: This was a good HTML/CSS review.

Day 5 January 14., 2017:
Progress: Pseduo-coded the algorithm for the Roman Numeral Converter on Free Code Camp. 

Thoughts: I really like scripting.

Days 6-8 January 15-17, 2017:
Progress: Finished the Roman Numeral Converter for Free Code Camp. Invested 4+ hours so far muddling my way through the WhereforeArtThou challenge. 

Thoughts: Am I cheating by updating this in chunks like this? This challenge is complex and, well, challenging. I've tried a couple different approaches and have concluded (after collaborating with other campers in chat) that there is no way around using nested for loops. I'm thinking I'll have to draw a picuture of it and do more pseudo-coding to help think through it. It's good to be working on something more challenging. 

Link to work: I don't have too much to show today since there isn't a solution to what I've been working on.

Day 11 January 20, 2017:
Progress: Continued work on Wherefore Art Thou, and developed a concept for a pen on CodePen. 

Thoughts: Slow and steady.
