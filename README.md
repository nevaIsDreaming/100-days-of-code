# 100-days-of-code
I'm committing to code one hour a day for 100 days! This will be perfect for my coding habit 

Day 1, Jaunary 9, 2017:
A bit late to the party here since everyone else started last week. Let's agree that it's just fashionable.

Today's Progress: Joined the challenge. Worked on intermediate algorithm scripting on FCC. 

Thoughts: I'm a tad bit rusty on all of this since I took a substantial holiday break, but I'm picking up where I left off.

Day 2&3, January 11-12, 2017:
Progress: Finished my Wikipedia Viewer for Free Code Camp today. 

Thoughts: It was fun playing around with all the CSS styling on this page. I kept it very basic, but it was a good review.

Day 4 January 13, 2017:
Progress: Did a lot to update my personal portfolio page. I added a biography section to the page.

Thoughts: This was a good HTML/CSS review.

Day 5 January 14., 2017:
Progress: Pseduo-coded the algorithm for the Roman Numeral Converter on Free Code Camp. 

Thoughts: I really like scripting.

Days 6-8 January 15-17, 2017:
Progress: Finished the Roman Numeral Converter for Free Code Camp. Invested 4+ hours so far muddling my way through the WhereforeArtThou challenge. 

Thoughts: Am I cheating by updating this in chunks like this? This challenge is complex and, well, challenging. I've tried a couple different approaches and have concluded (after collaborating with other campers in chat) that there is no way around using nested for loops. I'm thinking I'll have to draw a picuture of it and do more pseudo-coding to help think through it. It's good to be working on something more challenging. 

Link to work: I don't have too much to show today since there isn't a solution to what I've been working on.

Day 11 January 20, 2017:
Progress: Continued work on Wherefore Art Thou, and developed a concept for a pen on CodePen. 

Thoughts: Slow and steady.

Days 12-19 January 21-29th:
Progress: The first couple of days of this last week were spent on finishing the Wherefore Art Thou algorithm. More intermediate algorithms. Today and yesterday I worked more on the basic website prototype. Today's work focused on customizing a bootstrap navbar. 

Thoughts: After finally coming up with a solution to Wherefore Art Thou, I rejoiced and then cruised through the next few challenges. My little design project is coming along too. At this point, an error in the code somewhere is preventing the dropdowns from working, or the collapsibilty for smaller screens. Yikes! Here comes the trouble shooting!

Days 20-25 January 30 to February 4th:
Progress: Algorithm scripting challenges. 

Thoughts: Not so easy to do while sick.
